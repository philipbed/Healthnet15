# Healthnet2015
A class project for a health management system, for the use of hospitals administrators, their staff, and the patients who will be receiving assistance. 

Tools that were use for this project were Django 1.8 on Python 3.4 and SQLite 3.7. For design of the user inteface we used Bootsrap UI framework and FullCalendar.io  For automated testing we used the selenium web driver firefox plugin.
